                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>"Rich Dad Poor Dad" is a best-selling personal finance book by Robert Kiyosaki. It tells the story of Kiyosaki's two dads - his real father, who was highly educated but struggled financially, and his best friend's father, who was a high school dropout but became a wealthy businessman.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The book emphasizes the importance of financial literacy, cash flow, and investments. Kiyosaki argues that the traditional educational system does not teach people how to manage money or build wealth, and encourages readers to seek financial education outside of the classroom.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Kiyosaki advocates for a mindset shift from being an employee to being an investor and entrepreneur. He emphasizes the importance of creating passive income streams through investments such as real estate, stocks, and business ventures.

                    <br>
                    
                    The book also touches on the importance of taking calculated risks and overcoming fear and self-doubt in pursuing financial success.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Overall, "Rich Dad Poor Dad" is a motivational and educational book that encourages readers to take control of their finances and strive for financial independence.

                <h1>Chapter-1(Rich Dad Poor Dad)</h1>
                <p>Chapter 1 of "Rich Dad Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki introduces the author and the two dads he learned from, his "rich dad" and his "poor dad." Kiyosaki's "poor dad" was his biological father, who had a Ph.D. and a high-paying job as an educator but struggled financially. Kiyosaki's "rich dad" was the father of his best friend, who didn't have a college education but was extremely wealthy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Kiyosaki explains that his two dads had different beliefs about money and success. His poor dad believed that education was the key to success and that working for a salary was the best way to make a living. His rich dad, on the other hand, believed in learning about money and investing in assets to generate passive income.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Kiyosaki also introduces the concept of financial literacy, which he defines as "the ability to read and understand financial statements." He argues that financial literacy is not taught in schools and that many people, including his poor dad, struggle financially because they don't understand the basics of money management.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, Kiyosaki emphasizes that the ideas he learned from his rich dad are not just about making money but about achieving financial freedom and independence. He believes that everyone has the potential to become financially literate and achieve financial success, regardless of their background or education.</p>
